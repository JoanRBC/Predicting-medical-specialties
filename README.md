# Predicting Medical Specialties - Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project  

## Overview  

Machine learning in healthcare is one such area which is seeing gradual acceptance in the healthcare industry. Many companies are entering the field not because they want to, but because they have to, one of many examples available is the Google medical AI for disease detection (https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/27/1000658/google-medical-ai-accurate-lab-real-life-clinic-covid-diabetes-retina-disease/).  
The top three applications are:  

-Diagnoses of diseases considered hard to diagnose,  
-Early drug discovery process and manufacturing, and  
-Medical imaging diagnosis. 

With this project, I tried to simulate as much as possible the workflow data analysts and scientists use in a company. For this, I followed many steps, starting by cleaning my dataset(available in Kaggle), , with ETL pipelines

Used medical transcriptions to implement a machine learning model that predicts the medical specialty to which each patient belongs.
